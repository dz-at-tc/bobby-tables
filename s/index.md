**School**: Hi, this is your son's school. We're having some computer trouble.

**Mom**: Oh, dear -- Did he break something?

**School**: In a way. Did you really name your son `Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--`?

**Mom**: Oh. Yes. Little Bobby Tables we call him.

**School**: Well, we've lost this year's student records. I hope you're happy.

**Mom**: And I hope you've learned to sanitize your database inputs.
