# PHP

PHP is a little more disorganized than how
[Perl handles parameters](./perl.html).  The standard [MySQL
extension][mysql] doesn't support parameterization, but that extension
has been out of date for more than five years and you should definitely 
use [one of the alternatives][which-mysql] instead. The 
[PostgreSQL extension][pg] does:

    $result = pg_query_params( $dbh, 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1', array($email) );

Note that the query must be in single quotes or have the `$` escaped
to avoid PHP trying to parse it as a variable.  (Actually, in this
case PHP will not see `$1` as a variable and will not interpolate
it, but for the sake of good practice, single-quote any strings
with dollar signs that you want to keep as dollar signs.

**However**, you should probably be using an abstraction layer.
The [ODBC][odbc] and [PDO][pdo] extensions both support parameterization
and multiple databases:

## Using mysqli

The MySQL Improved extension handles bound parameters.

    $stmt = $db->prepare('update people set name = ? where id = ?');
    $stmt->bind_param('si',$name,$id);
    $stmt->execute();

## Using ADODB

ADODB provides a way to prepare, bind and execute all in the same method call.

    $dbConnection = NewADOConnection($connectionString);
    $sqlResult = $dbConnection->Execute(
        'SELECT user_id,first_name,last_name FROM users WHERE username=? AND password=?',
        array($_REQUEST['username'], sha1($_REQUEST['password'])
    );

## Using the ODBC layer

    $stmt = odbc_prepare( $conn, 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?' );
    $success = odbc_execute( $stmt, array($email) );

Or:

    $dbh = odbc_exec($conn, 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', array($email));
    $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email');
    $sth->execute(array(':email' => $email));

## Using the PDO layer

Here's the long way to do bind parameters.

    $dbh = new PDO('mysql:dbname=testdb;host=127.0.0.1', $user, $password);
    $stmt = $dbh->prepare('INSERT INTO REGISTRY (name, value) VALUES (:name, :value)');
    $stmt->bindParam(':name', $name);
    $stmt->bindParam(':value', $value);

    // insert one row
    $name = 'one';
    $value = 1;
    $stmt->execute();

And a shorter way to pass things in.

    $dbh = new PDO('mysql:dbname=testdb;host=127.0.0.1', $user, $password);
    $stmt = $dbh->prepare('UPDATE people SET name = :new_name WHERE id = :id');
    $stmt->execute( array('new_name' => $name, 'id' => $id) );

Here's a great [tutorial on migrating to PDO for MySQL developers](http://wiki.hashphp.org/PDO_Tutorial_for_MySQL_Developers).

# Applications & Frameworks

## CakePHP

When using the MVC framework [CakePHP][cakephp], most of your
database communication will be abstracted away by the Model API.
Still, it is sometimes necessary to perform manual queries, which
can be done with [Model::query][cake-model-query]. In order to use
prepared statements with that method, you just need to pass an
additional array parameter after the SQL query string.  There are
two variants:

    // Unnamed placeholders: Pass an array containing one element for each ?
    $this->MyModel->query(
        'SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = ? AND status = ?',
        array($id, $status)
    );

    // Named placeholders: Pass an associative array
    $this->MyModel->query(
        'SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = :id AND status = :status',
        array('id' => $id, 'status' => $status)
    );

This behavior is documented in the [CakePHP Cookbook][cake-cookbook].
(It is described for the `fetchAll()`-method, but `query()` uses
`fetchAll()` internally).

## Fat-Free

In [Fat-Free][fatfree] you are able to easily use free form SQL queries from the [DB\SQL][fatfree-sql] class as well as the built
in [mappers][fatfree-mappers].

    // Raw SQL fetchAll
    $results = $f3->DB->exec(
        "SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = ? AND is_active = ?",
        [ $id, $is_active ]
    );
    
    // Raw SQL insert/update
    $f3->DB->exec("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)", [ $name, $email ]);

    // used with the mapper
    $user = new \DB\SQL\Mapper($f3->DB, 'users');
    $user->load([ "id = ?", $id ]);
    $user->name = 'Bobby Tables';
    $user->email = 'bobby@bobby-tables.com';
    $user->save();

## WordPress

If your site/blog/application is running on [WordPress][WP], you
can use the `prepare` method of the `$wpdb` class, which supports
both a sprintf()-like and vsprintf()-like syntax.

    global $wpdb;
    $wpdb->query(
        $wpdb->prepare( 'SELECT name FROM people WHERE id = %d OR email = %s',
            $person_id, $person_email
        )
    );

For INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs, you can use the handy helper methods in the class, which allow you to specify the format of the submitted values.

    global $wpdb;
    $wpdb->insert( 'people',
            array(
                'person_id' => '123',
                'person_email' => 'bobby@tables.com'
            ),
        array( '%d', '%s' )
    );
